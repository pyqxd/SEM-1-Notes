# 1. Computer System Concepts
## 1.1) What is a Computer?

A computer is an electronic device that can accept data as input, process it according to a set of instructions (called a program), and produce useful output. At its core, a computer performs mathematical and logical operations at very high speeds, making it a valuable tool for solving difficult problems, storing large amounts of information, and doing repetitive tasks automatically.

### 1.2) Characteristics of a Computer System

- **Speed:** Computers can perform millions (or even billions) of calculations in a fraction of a second. This is far beyond human capability. For example, a complex weather forecast that would take a human months to calculate can be done by a supercomputer in minutes. 
    
- **Accuracy:** Computers are incredibly accurate. If the input data and the instructions (the program) are correct, the output will be 100% correct. Any errors are almost always due to human error in the input or programming. 
    
- **Diligence:** Unlike humans, computers are immune to tiredness, boredom, and lack of concentration. They can work continuously for hours without making any errors. This makes them ideal for repetitive and tedious tasks. tireless
    
- **Versatility:** Computers are multi-purpose machines. They can perform a wide variety of tasks. The same computer can be used for playing games, watching movies, sending emails, creating documents, and much more. 
    
- **Storage Capacity:** Computers can store vast amounts of information in a very small space. This information can be retrieved almost instantly whenever needed. This is a huge advantage over traditional paper-based storage. 
    
- **Automation:** Once a program is in the computer's memory, the computer can execute it without any human involvement. This ability to automate tasks is a key feature of computers.
    
- **Reliability:** Modern electronic components have long lives and computers are designed to be reliable. They can perform the same type of task repeatedly with the same accuracy. 

### 1.3) Capabilities and Limitations of a Computer System

**Capabilities:**

- **Complex Calculations:** Computers are very good at doing complex mathematical and logical operations that would be hard or impossible for humans to do.
    
- **Data Processing:** They can process large volumes of data quickly and efficiently, identifying patterns and trends that might be missed by humans.
    
- **Communication:** Computers have transformed communication, making it possible for people to connect instantly anywhere in the world through the internet.

### 1.7) Central Processing Unit (CPU) - The Brain 

The **CPU** is called **_the brain of computer_** as it controls operation of all parts of computer. It consists of two components:

- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** The ALU is the **digital calculator** and **decision-maker** of the computer. It's the part of the CPU that actually performs the calculations and comparisons.
    
    - **Function:** The ALU performs all the arithmetic and logical operations.
        
    - **Arithmetic Operations:** These include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
        
    - **Logical Operations:** These include comparisons like less than (<), greater than (>), equal to (=), etc. All calculations and decisions are made in the ALU.
        
- **Control Unit (CU):** It doesn't perform any actual data processing but instead manages and coordinates all the activities within the computer. 
    
    - **Function:** The CU acts like the nervous system of the computer. It doesn't process data itself but manages and coordinates the activities of all the other units of the computer.
        
    - **Characteristics:** It fetches instructions from the memory, decodes them, and directs the flow of data between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices. It controls the timing of operations and ensures that all tasks are executed in the correct sequence.

### 1.8) The Memory Hierarchy

![memory](memory.png)

- **Top of the Pyramid:** Fastest speed, smallest capacity, highest cost.
    
- **Bottom of the Pyramid:** Slowest speed, largest capacity, lowest cost.

###  1.9) Registers

- **What they are:** Registers are the **smallest and fastest** memory locations available in a computer system. They are not part of the main memory but are located directly on the CPU chip itself.
    
- **Function:** They hold the data, instructions, and addresses that the CPU is currently working on. Because they are on the same chip, the CPU can access them almost instantaneously.
    
- **Analogy:** Think of registers as the hands of a chef. They hold the exact ingredients (data) the chef is working with at that very moment.

### 1.10) Cache Memory

- **What it is:** Cache is a small, extremely fast, and expensive memory that sits between the CPU and the main RAM.
    
- **Function:** Its purpose is to store copies of the data and instructions from RAM that are most frequently used by the CPU. When the CPU needs data, it first checks the cache. This process significantly speeds up the overall system performance.

### 1.11) RAM - Random Access Memory

**RAM** is the computer’s main memory where it keeps data it’s actively using. It’s called “Random Access” because the CPU can quickly reach any spot in RAM directly, without going step by step.

#### Characteristics of RAM

- **Volatile:** RAM is **volatile**, meaning it requires power to maintain the stored information. If the computer is turned off, all data in RAM is lost.
    
- **Read/Write Memory:** You can both write data to and read data from RAM.
    
- **Speed:** Much faster than secondary storage (like an HDD) but slower than cache and registers.
    

#### Types of RAM

RAM is broadly divided into two main types: SRAM and DRAM.

| Feature            | **SRAM (Static RAM)**                      | **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technology**     | Uses flip-flops to store each bit.         | Uses a transistor and a capacitor to store each bit.                                           |
| **Speed**          | **Faster**. Does not need to be refreshed. | **Slower**. The capacitor leaks charge, so it must be refreshed thousands of times per second. |
| **Size & Density** | Less dense. Takes up more space per bit.   | More dense. Can store more bits in the same physical space.                                    |
| **Cost**           | **More expensive**.                        | **Less expensive**.                                                                            |
| **Power Usage**    | Consumes more power when idle.             | Consumes less power.                                                                           |
| **Typical Use**    | **Cache Memory**                           | **Main System Memory**                                                                         |

#### Pros and Cons of RAM

- **Pros:**
    
    - **Fast Access:** Allows for quick retrieval and storage of data, which is crucial for running applications smoothly.
        
    - **Essential for Multitasking:** More RAM allows the computer to run more programs simultaneously without slowing down.

    - **Volatile:** Data loss on power off.
        
    - **Limited Capacity:** Compared to secondary storage, it has a much smaller capacity.
        
    - **Cost:** More expensive per gigabyte than secondary storage.

### 1.12) ROM - Read-Only Memory

**ROM** is a type of non-volatile memory. The data stored in ROM is permanent and does not get erased when the computer is turned off.

#### Characteristics of ROM

- **Non-Volatile:** Retains its contents even when the power is off.
    
- **Read-Only:** As the name suggests, under normal operation, data can only be read from ROM. It cannot be easily changed or written to.
    
- **Function:** It is primarily used to store the **firmware** for the computer, which includes the **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)** or **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)**. This is the initial program that runs when the computer is turned on, responsible for starting the computer, testing the hardware, and loading the operating system.
    

#### Types of ROM

- **ROM:** The very first type. Data is written onto it during the manufacturing process and can never be changed.
    
- **PROM (Programmable ROM):** Can be programmed **once** by the user with a special tool. After it's programmed, it cannot be erased or changed.
    
- **EPROM (Erasable and Programmable ROM):** Can be erased by exposing it to strong **ultraviolet light** for a period of time, after which it can be reprogrammed.
    
- **EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable ROM):** Can be erased and reprogrammed **electrically** without removing it from the computer. This is the most flexible type of ROM and is used for storing the BIOS in most modern computers, allowing for easy updates. **Flash memory**, used in SSDs and USB drives, is a type of EEPROM.

### 1.13) Input/Output (I/O) & Storage Units

**Output Devices:** These devices display the processed information from the computer.

- **Monitors (Visual Display Unit - VDU):** The primary output device for displaying visual information.
    
    - **Characteristics:**
        
        - **Size:** Measured diagonally across the screen.
            
        - **Resolution:** The number of pixels on the screen (e.g., 1920x1080). Higher resolution means a sharper image.
            
        - **Refresh Rate:** The number of times per second the screen image is redrawn, measured in Hertz (Hz). A higher refresh rate results in smoother motion.
            
        - **Dot Pitch:** The distance between the pixels on the screen. A smaller dot pitch means a sharper image.
            
    - **Video Standards:** Determine the resolution and color depth (e.g., **VGA**, **SVGA**, **XGA**).
        
- **Printers:** Produce a hard copy of documents.
    
    - **Impact Printers:** (e.g., **Dot Matrix**, **Daisy Wheel**) Physically strike the paper to create an image. They are noisy and produce lower quality output.
        
    - **Non-Impact Printers:** (e.g., **Inkjet**, **Laser**) Do not physically touch the paper. They are faster, quieter, and produce higher quality output.
        
    - **Line Printer:** A type of impact printer that prints an entire line at a time.
        
    - **Plotter:** Used to print vector graphics, often for engineering drawings and architectural blueprints.
