## 1. What is Multimedia?

Multimedia means using different types of media together to share information in an interactive way. Unlike traditional media that only uses text or pictures, multimedia mixes things like text, images, audio, and video to make the experience more engaging.

##### The core components of multimedia are:

- **Text:** The foundation for information.
- **Graphics:** 2D/3D images, illustrations, and logos.
- **Audio:** Music, voice-overs, and sound effects.
- **Video:** Moving pictures, typically with sound.
- **Animation:** The illusion of motion created from a sequence of images.

##### The importance of using multimedia is significant:

- It **makes communication clearer** by showing information in different ways.
- It **helps people learn better**, since visuals and sounds can simplify difficult topics.
- It **keeps users involved**, letting them interact with the content instead of just watching.
